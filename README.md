Project resulting from technical testing, with the objective of writing a user story to determine what needs to be developed, respecting TDD as a pattern.
In the solution folder there is the UserStory folder, where I described the tasks and their acceptance criteria. I also created flowcharts to give a better view of what the code needs to do.
I chose MongoDB as the repository. As there was a requirement not to use known ORMs such as Dapper and EntityFramework, I ruled out the use of SQLServer and other relational databases, and using MongoDB it was easier to have Docker working together as well.
